README - Orthotimer_algorithm.m

The Orthotimer algorithm can detect footwear use and non-use based on temperature data assessed with an Orhotimer sensor.


INSTRUCTIONS

Include the "Orthotimer algorithm" folder including its sub folder (Functions) to your MATLAB path.

If the path is set, you can run Orthotimer_algorithm.m.


CONTENTS

Folder "Functions" contains functions used in Orthotimer_algorithm.m.

Main function -> [M] = Orthotimer_algorithm(file)

IMPORTANT -> Set time zone in line 23 (setTimeZone = 'Europe/Amsterdam'; %Set prefered time zone)

Multiple_sensors_analyses.m is an example script how to run Orthotimer_algorithm.m mulitiple times with different input files.


INPUT

file -> fill in the name of the csv file extracted from cloud.orthotimer.com as character, for example: 'E0-38-02-10-05-18-2D-FD_10_26_2021.csv'


OUTPUT

M -> matrix including:

M.(csvName).startdate     -> start date sensor (datetime)
M.(csvName).enddate       -> end date sensor (datetime)
M.(csvName).sampletime    -> sample time sensor (double)
M.(csvName).sensor        -> matrix with footwear on (=1) and footwear off (n=0) for each measurement (dependent on sample time) (double)
M.(csvName).dayTbl        -> day table with number of samples footwear on (n=1) per day (time footwear on are dependent on sample time) (timetable)
M.(csvName).dayTblHrs     -> day table with hours of wearing time per day (adjusted for sampletime) (timetable)
M.(csvName).SensorOnMat   -> table with footwear on (=1) and footwear off (n=0) for each measurement (dependent on sample time) (timetable)


FUNCTIONS

In order of script:

- lowpassfilter.m			-> Applies lowpass filter to sensor 
- determinationpeaks.m			-> Find peaks (maxIdx) and minima (minIdx) of Orthotimer data
- check_24h.m				-> Check if <24h between maxIdx and minIdx, if not, remove maxIdx. If there is no maxIdx before the minIdx, remove minIdx as well.

% Below functions are run twice in Orthotimer_algorithm.m
- peak_gap_first.m			-> Check if there is a (series of) last positive peak(s) before a gap or first a (series of) negative peak(s) after a gap.
- check_multiple_peaks.m		-> Check if there are multiple MaxIdx / MinIdx in a row
- double_max_1h.m			-> If double max indices are within 1h, keep first MaxIdx
- double_min_1h.m			-> If double min indices are within 1h, keep last MinIdx
- double_max_2.m			-> If double max indices are > 1h, keep MaxIdx based on temperature
- double_min_2.m			-> If double min indices are > 1h, keep MinIdx based on temperature
- peak_gap_second.m			-> Check if there is a (serie) last positive peak(s) before a gap or first a (serie) negative peak(s) after a gap
% Ends here

- firstMax_lastMin			-> First index should be a MaxIdx and last index should be a MinIdx


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

We developed a script to combine wearing time of multiple sensors of one patient/participant. This script can be useful when a patient/participant has for example multiple pairs of footwear.
